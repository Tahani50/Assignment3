Form Validation
This project features a User Registration Form with real-time JavaScript validation and an integrated API data fetch. It ensures users provide valid inputs by checking for non-empty fields, proper email format, and enforcing strong password criteria (minimum 8 characters, including uppercase, lowercase, number, and special character). The form provides instant feedback with clear error messages for incorrect inputs. Additionally, it includes an asynchronous API call to fetch user data from JSONPlaceholder, dynamically displaying user names and emails upon button click. Built using modern ES6+ JavaScript features like arrow functions, template literals, and async/await for clean and efficient code.
